    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of AP flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cp white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter softened</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds cream cheese softened</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp AP flour</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees farenheit. Lightly coat a 10 inch springform pan with spray oil. You can also
            use a 9x13 inch pan</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup butter or margarine. Spread
            to the edges of the pan. Prick all over with a fork, then bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees farenheit. Allow to
            cool.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temperature to 475 degrees farenheit. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar,
            3 tbsp flour, 5 eggs and the yolks and mix thoroughly. Add cream and mix only enough to blend.</li>
        <li>Pour filling over crust and bake for 10 minutes at 475 degrees farenheit. Reduce temperature to 200 degrees
            farenheit and continue to bake for one hour. Turn oven off, but leave cake in for another hour. Don't worry
            if it looks a little jiggly in the center.</li>
        <li>Chill overnight. This is imperative! If desired, top with your favorite fruit or serve plain.</li>
    </ol>

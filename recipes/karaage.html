    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Karaage is a common sight in japanese meals. These amazing fried chicken nuggets (in western terms) is one of the
        Japanese people's favorite foods. The end result of this recipe is a crunch that will arouse even the very ants
        under your house. Still let's not get mugged by those little fellows.</p>
    <p>Karaage has much resemblence to what we call chicken nuggets and they truly are similar; they're chunks of
        chicken fried and made to be crispy. But on top of the similar looks with a touch of Japanese style
        cooking is what we call karaage. </p>
